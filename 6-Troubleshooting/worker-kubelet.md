  <summary markdown="span">Solution</summary>

1. Verify sure all your worker nodes are healthy

List the nodes and make sure they all have the status Ready

```
k get no
```

Describe the worker nodes to get additional information

```
k describe node worker1
```

2. Stop the kubelet process on the worker1

First run a shell on worker1, then stop kubelet (it is managed by *systemd*)

```
sudo systemctl stop kubelet
```

Make sure it is correctly stopped

```
sudo systemctl status kubelet
```

3. Check the status of worker1

From the list of node, worker1 should appear as NotReady

```
k get no
```

Describing worker1 yoy should see the node as an unknown status (*NodeStatusUnknown*)

```
k describe node worker1
```

4. Restart the kubelet process on worker1 and make sure everything is now fine

First run a shell on worker1, then start kubelet

```
sudo systemctl start kubelet
```

Make sure it is correctly started

```
sudo systemctl status kubelet
```

Listing the node or describing *worker1* you should see everything is back to normal
